Neural Machine Translation with Attention
âœ… Score: 60/70

Overview
Built an English-to-Portuguese Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model using LSTM with Attention in TensorFlow.

Key Tasks
âœ” Implemented an Encoder-Decoder architecture with attention
âœ” Trained the model on parallel corpus
âœ” Used greedy & Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for translation
âœ” Evaluated translations with ROUGE-1 similarity

ðŸš€ Hands-on experience with Attention-based NMT!
