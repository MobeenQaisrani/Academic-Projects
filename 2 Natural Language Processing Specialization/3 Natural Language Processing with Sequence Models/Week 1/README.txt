Deep N-grams (RNN-based Text Generation)
âœ… Score: 40/50

Overview
Implemented Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for text generation using Deep N-grams in TensorFlow.

Key Tasks
âœ” Converted text into tensor format
âœ” Created a TensorFlow dataset
âœ” Defined and trained a GRU-based language model
âœ” Evaluated model performance using perplexity
âœ” Generated new text using the trained model

ðŸš€ Hands-on experience with RNNs and language modeling!
