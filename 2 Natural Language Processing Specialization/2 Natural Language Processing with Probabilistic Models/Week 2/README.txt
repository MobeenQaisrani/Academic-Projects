âœ… Score: 70/80

Overview
Implemented POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the Viterbi algorithm to classify words into categories like Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.

Key Tasks
âœ” Created transition and emission matrices for HMMs
âœ” Implemented the Viterbi algorithm for sequence prediction
âœ” Evaluated model accuracy

ðŸš€ Built a POS tagging model for better text understanding!
